1. Data Sources:
	US News < HTML >
		Obtain interesting info of National Universities which are listed on US News site. 13 features are considered: name, ranking, state, city, type, found year, endowment, tuitions and fees, and etc.
		Need to parse 311 universities listed on 16 pages. For each university, 3 pages are required to obtain all interested features / info. Totally 949 pages of HTML are requested.
		Challenge Point: 8
	Google Places < API >
		Obtain latitude - longitude data for each university for plotting them on the map.
		1 request for each university. 311 requests are needed totally.
		Challenge Point: 2
	US BEA < CSV File >
		Obtain GDP data for each state from 1997 to 2016. (past 20 years, unit: million dollars)
		Directly extract data from CSV file. (61 rows * 22 columns)
		Challenge Point: 0
	Github < JSON File >
		Obtain corresponding relations between two-letter abbreviations and full names of each state.
		Directly extract data from CSV file. (59 records)
		Challenge Point: 0
	Total Challenge Point: 10

2. Presentation Options:
	Table
		A list of National Universities of a given state or several states.
		A list of GDP data of a given state or several states. (still under consideration)
	Plot
		A bar plot showing how many National Universities belong to each state in US.
			X - axis: State, Y - axis: Number of National Universities
		A scatter plot attempting to show the relationship between number of National Universities and GDP value of states. (Endowment is also considered)
			X - axis: Number of National Universities, Y - axis: GDP of State
		A scatter plot showing difference between public and private National Universities. 
			X - axis: Enrollment, Y - axis: Median Starting Salary
		A line plot showing GDP data (trend) of a given state or several states.
			X - axis: Year, Y - axis: GDP of State
		A map showing location of National Universities in a given state.

3. Presentation Tools
	Plotly - a kind of API based data visualization tool used to make plots.
	Django - a framework to create HTML to make interactive functions and show data tables.
		* Planned data communication method: AJAX
		* Planned table (visualization) framework: DataTables.js
		* Planned plot (visualization) framework: None (redirecting to Plotly instead of using d3.js)

4. Current Progress
	All data were parsed / requested and cached.
	Database was built, and all data were uploaded / inserted.
	Several important classes were defined (like class < NationalUniversity >).
	All plotting functions were finished.
	Some unittest were developed.

5. Future Tasks
	Improve code structures.
	Develop unittest.
	Set up Django framework and write HTML and JavaScript.
